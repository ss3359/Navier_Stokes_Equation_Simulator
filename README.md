# Navier_Stokes_Equation_Simulator

This is a Python program computing for the general solution for the Navier-Stokes' Equations. This is a system of differential equations that implements the Runge-Kutta method to find the pressure coordinates given a velocity vector, viscosity and the external forces of a fluid. I hope you enjoy reading my code and project.
